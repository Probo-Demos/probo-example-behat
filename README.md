# Probo Example for Behat and Drupal 8
This repository contains an example .probo.yaml file that is configured to download the latest version of Drupal 8 from Drupal.org and install it using Composer inside a Probo.CI Build. Behat is then installed and configured to run some simple tests on the site in the build. The Behat tests are run in a separate Probo Build step so you can view the output easily.

Fork the repository to easily get a Drupal 8 Behat sandbox site setup in Probo.CI.
